# EmotionScan
EmotionScan is a tool designed to analyze and interpret human emotions using advanced machine learning techniques. This project aims to provide insights into emotional states through facial recognition and sentiment analysis.

## Features

- **Facial Emotion Recognition**: Detects emotions such as happiness, sadness, anger, and more.
- **Sentiment Analysis**: Analyzes text input to determine emotional tone.
- **Real-Time Processing**: Supports live emotion detection via webcam or video feed.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Easy-to-use interface for seamless interaction.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.11 or higher
- A modern web browser with webcam support
- [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) for managing Python packages

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/EmotionScan.git
    cd EmotionScan
    ```

2. Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):

    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
    ```

3. Install the required dependencies:

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage

1. Start the Flask application:

    ```bash
    python main.py
    ```

2. Open your browser and navigate to `http://127.0.0.1:5000`.

3. Grant camera permissions when prompted.

4. Start detecting emotions in real-time!

## Deployment

This project is configured to run on Replit or any server with Gunicorn. To deploy:

1. Install Gunicorn:

    ```bash
    pip install gunicorn
    ```

2. Run the application with Gunicorn:

    ```bash
    gunicorn --bind 0.0.0.0:5000 main:app
    ```

3. Expose the application to the internet using a service like ngrok or deploy it to a cloud platform.
